# TOF10120 module I2C usage

Simple code to read distance measurements (in mm) from a [TOF10120 LIDAR module](https://www.banggood.com/search/tof10120.html?from=nav). Based on [VL53L0X chip](https://www.banggood.com/search/vl53lox.html?from=nav). Both of them quite cheap.

Adapted from code of [https://surtrtech.com](https://surtrtech.com/2019/03/18/easy-use-of-tof-10120-laser-rangefinder-to-measure-distance-with-arduino-lcd/).
